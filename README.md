# Just a Bot

A small, dumb, and consistent chatbot.

It answers randomly, does not understand emotions, and is not intelligent on purpose.

## Features
- Random replies
- Keyword-based responses
- No emotion detection
- Simple logic
- Retro-style chat interface

## Why
This bot is intentionally simple.  
No AI.  
No learning.  
Just logic and randomness.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser.  
Type something.  
Receive a response.

## Notes
This project is public and meant for fun and experimentation.
